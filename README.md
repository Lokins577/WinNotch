# WinNotch

WinNotch is a Dynamic Island-inspired notch overlay for Windows. It brings media controls, calendar, battery, webcam, volume and brightness HUDs, file staging, and installable plugins into a compact surface that can live at the top or side of the screen.

Built with `WPF`, `.NET 8`, and `C#`.

## Install

### Release build

1. Download the latest installer from [Releases](https://github.com/N3uralCreativity/WinNotch/releases/latest).
2. Run `WinNotch-Setup.exe`.
3. Launch WinNotch.

### Build from source

Requirements:

- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/N3uralCreativity/WinNotch.git
cd WinNotch
dotnet run --project src/WinNotch/WinNotch.csproj
```

To create a publish folder:

```bash
dotnet publish src/WinNotch/WinNotch.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained -p:PublishSingleFile=true -o publish
```

## Plugins

WinNotch supports several plugin types:

- `IUIPlugin`
- `IServicePlugin`
- `IAnimationPlugin`
- `IConfigurablePlugin`

Plugins can be installed in two ways:

1. From the in-app Plugin Browser.
2. Manually by placing a plugin DLL in `%AppData%\WinNotch\Plugins\<plugin-id>\`.

The in-app browser only shows plugins listed in the `WinNotch-Plugins` repository's `library.json`. If a plugin is not listed there, it will not appear in the browser even if the DLL exists elsewhere.

## Create plugins

If you want to build plugins:

- start with [PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT.md](PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT.md)
- use the ready-to-send [AI plugin prompt](AI_PLUGIN_PROMPT.md) if you want another AI to build a plugin from zero context
- browse the live examples in `Examples/Plugins`
- use the `WinNotch.PluginSdk` package from GitHub Packages if you do not want to clone the full repo

The package is intended for plugin authors, not end users. Runtime installation still happens through the WinNotch app or manual DLL deployment.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome for both the app and the plugin ecosystem.

- app changes and plugin API changes belong in this repository
- community plugin browser listings belong in [WinNotch-Plugins](https://github.com/N3uralCreativity/WinNotch-Plugins)

If you want your plugin to appear in the browser, publish the DLL publicly, then add its manifest entry to `WinNotch-Plugins/library.json`.
